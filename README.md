# Hotel Management Networking using Cisco packet tracer

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a multi-floor network architecture for a hotel using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network design includes various networking technologies and configurations to ensure efficient and secure connectivity across multiple floors of a hotel.

## Technologies Used

- **VLAN Configuration**: Segregates network traffic to improve performance and security.
- **Wi-Fi Access Points**: Provides wireless connectivity throughout the hotel.
- **ACL (Access Control Lists)**: Controls network access and enhances security by filtering traffic.
- **DHCP Server Configuration**: Automates the assignment of IP addresses to devices within the network.
- **OSPF Routing Protocol**: Facilitates dynamic routing and efficient path selection across the network.

## Project Details

This Cisco Packet Tracer project involves:
- **Network Design**: Creating a detailed multi-floor network layout with proper connectivity.
- **Wireless Connectivity**: Setting up Wi-Fi access points to provide internet access in all hotel areas.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Configuring OSPF for dynamic routing to ensure efficient data transfer across different network segments.
- **Security**: Implementing ACLs to restrict unauthorized access and protect network resources.
